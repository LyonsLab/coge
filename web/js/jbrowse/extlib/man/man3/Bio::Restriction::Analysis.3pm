.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Bio::Restriction::Analysis describes the results of cutting a \s-1DNA\s0
sequence with restriction enzymes.
.PP
To use this module you can pass a sequence object and optionally a
Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection that contains the enzyme(s) to cut the
sequences with. There is a default set of enzymes that will be loaded
if you do not pass in a Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection.
.PP
To cut a sequence, set up a Restriction::Analysis object with a sequence
like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Bio::Restriction::Analysis;
\&  my $ra = Bio::Restriction::Analysis\->new(\-seq=>$seqobj);
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $ra = Bio::Restriction::Analysis\->new
\&      (\-seq=>$seqobj, \-enzymes=>$enzs);
.Ve
.PP
Then, to get the fragments for a particular enzyme use this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @fragments = $ra\->fragments(\*(AqEcoRI\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Note that the naming of restriction enzymes is that the last numbers
are usually Roman numbers (I, \s-1II\s0, \s-1III\s0, etc). You may want to use
something like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  # get a reference to an array of unique (single) cutters
\&  $singles = $re\->unique_cutters;
\&  foreach my $enz ($singles\->each_enzyme) {
\&      @fragments = $re\->fragments($enz);
\&      ... do something here ...
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Note that if your sequence is circular, the first and last fragment
will be joined so that they are the appropriate length and sequence
for further analysis. This fragment will also be checked for cuts
by the enzyme(s).  However, this will change the start of the
sequence!
.PP
There are two separate algorithms used depending on whether your
enzyme has ambiguity. The non-ambiguous algorithm is a lot faster,
and if you are using very large sequences you should try and use
this algorithm. If you have a large sequence (e.g. genome) and 
want to use ambgiuous enzymes you may want to make separate
Bio::Restriction::Enzyme objects for each of the possible
alternatives and make sure that you do not set is_ambiguous!
.PP
This version should correctly deal with overlapping cut sites
in both ambiguous and non-ambiguous enzymes.
.PP
I have tried to write this module with speed and memory in mind
so that it can be effectively used for large (e.g. genome sized)
sequence. This module only stores the cut positions internally,
and calculates everything else on an as-needed basis. Therefore
when you call fragment_maps (for example), there may be another
delay while these are generated.

This is the place to start. Pass in a sequence, and you will be able
to get the fragments back out.  Several other things are available
like the number of zero cutters or single cutters.

\& Returns  : $self
\& Args     : \*(Aqsingle\*(Aq (optional), \*(Aqmultiple\*(Aq with enzyme collection.
.Ve
.PP
An explicit cut method is needed to pass arguments to it.
.PP
There are two varieties of cut. Single is the default, and need
not be explicitly called. This cuts the sequence with each
enzyme separately.
.PP
Multiple cuts a sequence with more than one enzyme. You must pass
it a Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection object of the set
of enzymes that you want to use in the double digest. The results
will be stored as an enzyme named \*(L"multiple_digest\*(R", so you can
use all the retrieval methods to get the data.
.PP
If you want to use the default setting there is no need to call cut
directly. Every method in the class that needs output checks the
object's internal status and recalculates the cuts if needed.
.PP
Note: cut doesn't now re-initialize everything before figuring
out cuts. This is so that you can do multiple digests, or add more
data or whatever. You'll have to use new to reset everything.

sequences.

be created so you can get : other information about this multiple
digest. (\s-1TMTOWTDI\s0).
.PP
There is a minor problem with this and \f(CW$self\fR\->fragments that I
haven't got a good answer for (at the moment). If the sequence is not
cut, do we return undef, or the whole sequence?
.PP
For linear fragments it would be good to return the whole
sequence. For circular fragments I am not sure.
.PP
At the moment it returns the whole sequence with start of 1 and end of
length of the sequence.  For example:

\&             (in fact, delivers only minus strand cut positions in the 
\&              plus strand coordinates/maj)
\&  Returns  : A reference to an array of cut positions
\&  Arguments: The sequence to check and the enzyme object
\&  NOW DEPRECATED/maj

\& Title     : _ambig_cuts
\& Function  : An internal method to localize the cuts in the sequence
\& Returns   : A reference to an array of cut positions
\& Arguments : The separated enzyme site, the target sequence, and the enzyme object
\& Comments  : This is a slow implementation but works for ambiguous sequences.
\&             Whenever possible, _nonambig_cuts should be used as it is a lot faster.

An internal method. This will figure out where the sequence should be
cut, and provide the appropriate results.  This is a much faster
implementation because it doesn't use a regexp, but it can not deal
with ambiguous sequences

\& Title   : _make_cuts
\& Usage   : $an\->_make_cuts( $target_sequence, $enzyme, $complement_q )
\& Function: Returns an array of cut sites on target seq, using enzyme
\&           on the plus strand ($complement_q = 0) or minus strand
\&           ($complement_q = 1); follows Enzyme objects in

\& Returns : array of scalar integers

\& Title     : _multiple_cuts
\& Function  : Figures out multiple digests
\& Returns   : An array of the cut sites for multiply digested DNA
\& Arguments : A Bio::Restriction::EnzymeCollection object
\& Comments  : Double digests is one subset of this, but you can use
\&             as many enzymes as you want.
