.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Most GenBank entries for annotated genomic \s-1DNA\s0 contain a \fBflat\fR list
of features. These features can be parsed into an equivalent flat list
of Bio::SeqFeatureI objects using the standard Bio::SeqIO
classes. However, it is often desirable to \fBunflatten\fR this list into
something resembling actual \fBgene models\fR, in which genes, mRNAs and CDSs
are \fBnested\fR according to the nature of the gene model.
.PP
The BioPerl object model allows us to store these kind of associations
between SeqFeatures in \fBcontainment hierarchies\fR \*(-- any SeqFeatureI
object can contain nested SeqFeatureI objects. The
Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::Unflattener object facilitates construction of
these hierarchies from the underlying GenBank flat-feature-list
representation.
.PP
For example, if you were to look at a typical GenBank \s-1DNA\s0 entry, say,
\&\fB\s-1AE003644\s0\fR, you would see a flat list of features:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  source
\&
\&  gene CG4491
\&  mRNA CG4491\-RA
\&  CDS CG4491\-PA
\&
\&  gene tRNA\-Pro
\&  tRNA tRNA\-Pro
\&
\&  gene CG32954
\&  mRNA CG32954\-RA
\&  mRNA CG32954\-RC
\&  mRNA CG32954\-RB
\&  CDS CG32954\-PA
\&  CDS CG32954\-PB
\&  CDS CG32954\-PC
.Ve
.PP
These features have sequence locations, but it is not immediately
clear how to write code such that each mRNA is linked to the
appropriate \s-1CDS\s0 (other than relying on IDs which is very bad)
.PP
We would like to convert the above list into the \fBcontainment
hierarchy\fR, shown below:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  source
\&  gene
\&    mRNA CG4491\-RA
\&      CDS CG4491\-PA
\&      exon
\&      exon
\&  gene
\&    tRNA tRNA\-Pro
\&      exon
\&  gene
\&    mRNA CG32954\-RA
\&      CDS CG32954\-PA
\&      exon
\&      exon
\&    mRNA CG32954\-RC
\&      CDS CG32954\-PC
\&      exon
\&      exon
\&    mRNA CG32954\-RB
\&      CDS CG32954\-PB
\&      exon
\&      exon
.Ve
.PP
Where each feature is nested underneath its container. Note that exons
have been automatically inferred (even for tRNA genes).
.PP
We do this using a call on a Bio::SeqFeature::Tools::Unflattener
object
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  @sfs = $unflattener\->unflatten_seq(\-seq=>$seq);
.Ve
.PP
This would return a list of the \fBtop level\fR (i.e. container)
SeqFeatureI objects \- in this case, genes. Other top level features
are possible; for instance, the \fBsource\fR feature which is always
present, and other features such as \fBvariation\fR or \fBmisc_feature\fR
types.
.PP
The containment hierarchy can be accessed using the \fIget_SeqFeature()\fR
call on any feature object \- see Bio::SeqFeature::FeatureHolderI.
The following code will traverse the containment hierarchy for a
feature:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  sub traverse {
\&    $sf = shift;   #  $sf isa Bio::SeqfeatureI
\&
\&    # ...do something with $sf!
\&
\&    # depth first traversal of containment tree
\&    @contained_sfs = $sf\->get_SeqFeatures;
\&    traverse($_) foreach @contained_sfs;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Once you have built the hierarchy, you can do neat stuff like turn the
features into 'rich' feature objects (eg
Bio::SeqFeature::Gene::GeneStructure) or convert to a suitable
format such as \s-1GFF3\s0 or chadoxml (after mapping to the Sequence
Ontology); this step is not described here.
.SH "USING MAGIC"
.IX Header "USING MAGIC"
Due to the quixotic nature of how features are stored in
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ, there is no guarantee that the default behaviour of
this module will produce perfect results. Sometimes it is hard or
impossible to build a correct containment hierarchy if the information
provided is simply too lossy, as is often the case. If you care deeply
about your data, you should always manually inspect the resulting
containment hierarchy; you may have to customise the algorithm for
building the hierarchy, or even manually tweak the resulting
hierarchy. This is explained in more detail further on in the document.
.PP
However, if you are satisfied with the default behaviour, then you do
not need to read any further. Just make sure you set the parameter
\&\fBuse_magic\fR \- this will invoke incantations which will magically
produce good results no matter what the idiosyncracies of the
particular GenBank record in question.
.PP
For example
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $unflattener\->unflatten_seq(\-seq=>$seq,
\&                              \-use_magic=>1);
.Ve
.PP
The success of this depends on the phase of the moon at the time the
entry was submitted to GenBank. Note that the magical recipe is being
constantly improved, so the results of invoking magic may vary
depending on the bioperl release.
.PP
If you are skeptical of magic, or you wish to exact fine grained
control over how the entry is unflattened, or you simply wish to
understand more about how this crazy stuff works, then read on!
.SH "PROBLEMATIC DATA AND INCONSISTENCIES"
.IX Header "PROBLEMATIC DATA AND INCONSISTENCIES"
Occasionally the Unflattener will have problems with certain
records. For example, the record may contain inconsistent data \- maybe
there is an \fBexon\fR entry that has no corresponding \fBmRNA\fR location.
.PP
The default behaviour is to throw an exception reporting the problem,
if the problem is relatively serious \- for example, inconsistent data.
.PP
You can exert more fine grained control over this \- perhaps you want
the Unflattener to do the best it can, and report any problems. This
can be done \- refer to the methods.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  error_threshold()
\&
\&  get_problems()
\&
\&  report_problems()
\&
\&  ignore_problems()
.Ve
.SH "ALGORITHM"
.IX Header "ALGORITHM"
This is the default algorithm; you should be able to override any part
of it to customise.
.PP
The core of the algorithm is in two parts
.IP "Partitioning the flat feature list into groups" 4
.IX Item "Partitioning the flat feature list into groups"
.PD 0
.IP "Resolving the feature containment hierarchy for each group" 4
.IX Item "Resolving the feature containment hierarchy for each group"
.PD
.PP
There are other optional steps after the completion of these two
steps, such as \fBinferring exons\fR; we now describe in more detail what
is going on.
.SS "Partitioning into groups"
.IX Subsection "Partitioning into groups"
First of all the flat feature list is partitioned into \fBgroup\fRs.
.PP
The default way of doing this is to use the \fBgene\fR attribute; if we
look at two features from GenBank accession \s-1AE003644\s0.3:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&     gene            20111..23268
\&                     /gene="noc"
\&                     /locus_tag="CG4491"
\&                     /note="last curated on Thu Dec 13 16:51:32 PST 2001"
\&                     /map="35B2\-35B2"
\&                     /db_xref="FLYBASE:FBgn0005771"
\&     mRNA            join(20111..20584,20887..23268)
\&                     /gene="noc"
\&                     /locus_tag="CG4491"
\&                     /product="CG4491\-RA"
\&                     /db_xref="FLYBASE:FBgn0005771"
.Ve
.PP
Both these features share the same /gene tag which is \*(L"noc\*(R", so they
correspond to the same gene model (the \s-1CDS\s0 feature is not shown, but
this also has a tag-value /gene=\*(L"noc\*(R").
.PP
Not all groups need to correspond to gene models, but this is the most
common use case; later on we shall describe how to customise the
grouping.
.PP
Sometimes other tags have to be used; for instance, if you look at the
entire record for \s-1AE003644\s0.3 you will see you actually need the use the
/locus_tag attribute. This attribute is actually \fBnot present\fR in
most records!
.PP
You can override this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $collection\->unflatten_seq(\-seq=>$seq, \-group_tag=>\*(Aqlocus_tag\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, if you \fB\-use_magic\fR, the object will try and make a
guess as to what the correct group_tag should be.
.PP
At the end of this step, we should have a list of groups \- there is no
structure within a group; the group just serves to partition the flat
features. For the example data above, we would have the following groups.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  [ source ]
\&  [ gene mRNA CDS ]
\&  [ gene mRNA CDS ]
\&  [ gene mRNA CDS ]
\&  [ gene mRNA mRNA mRNA CDS CDS CDS ]
.Ve
.PP
\fIMulticopy Genes\fR
.IX Subsection "Multicopy Genes"
.PP
Multicopy genes are usually rRNAs or tRNAs that are duplicated across
the genome. Because they are functionally equivalent, and usually have
the same sequence, they usually have the same group_tag (ie gene
symbol); they often have a /note tag giving copy number. This means
they will end up in the same group. This is undesirable, because they
are spatially disconnected.
.PP
There is another step, which involves splitting spatially disconnected
groups into distinct groups
.PP
this would turn this
.PP
.Vb 1
\& [gene\-rrn3 rRNA\-rrn3 gene\-rrn3 rRNA\-rrn3]
.Ve
.PP
into this
.PP
.Vb 1
\& [gene\-rrn3 rRNA\-rrn3] [gene\-rrn3 rRNA\-rrn3]
.Ve
.PP
based on the coordinates
.PP
\fIWhat next?\fR
.IX Subsection "What next?"
.PP
The next step is to add some structure to each group, by making
\&\fBcontainment hierarchies\fR, trees that represent how the features
interrelate
.SS "Resolving the containment hierarchy"
.IX Subsection "Resolving the containment hierarchy"
After the grouping is done, we end up with a list of groups which
probably contain features of type 'gene', 'mRNA', '\s-1CDS\s0' and so on.
.PP
Singleton groups (eg the 'source' feature) are ignored at this stage.
.PP
Each group is itself flat; we need to add an extra level of
organisation. Usually this is because different spliceforms
(represented by the 'mRNA' feature) can give rise to different
protein products (indicated by the '\s-1CDS\s0' feature). We want to correctly
associate mRNAs to CDSs.
.PP
We want to go from a group like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  [ gene mRNA mRNA mRNA CDS CDS CDS ]
.Ve
.PP
to a containment hierarchy like this:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  gene
\&    mRNA
\&      CDS
\&    mRNA
\&      CDS
\&    mRNA
\&      CDS
.Ve
.PP
In which each \s-1CDS\s0 is nested underneath the correct corresponding mRNA.
.PP
For entries that contain no alternate splicing, this is simple; we
know that the group
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  [ gene mRNA CDS ]
.Ve
.PP
Must resolve to the tree
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  gene
\&    mRNA
\&      CDS
.Ve
.PP
How can we do this in entries with alternate splicing? The bad
news is that there is no guaranteed way of doing this correctly for
any GenBank entry. Occasionally the submission will have been done in
such a way as to reconstruct the containment hierarchy. However, this
is not consistent across databank entries, so no generic solution can
be provided by this object. This module does provide the framework
within which you can customise a solution for the particular dataset
you are interested in \- see later.
.PP
The good news is that there is an inference we can do that should
produce pretty good results the vast majority of the time. It uses
splice coordinate data \- this is the default behaviour of this module,
and is described in detail below.
.SS "Using splice site coordinates to infer containment"
.IX Subsection "Using splice site coordinates to infer containment"
If an mRNA is to be the container for a \s-1CDS\s0, then the splice site
coordinates (or intron coordinates, depending on how you look at it)
of the \s-1CDS\s0 must fit inside the splice site coordinates of the mRNA.
.PP
Ambiguities can still arise, but the results produced should still be
reasonable and consistent at the sequence level. Look at this fake
example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  mRNA    XXX\-\-\-XX\-\-XXXXXX\-\-XXXX         join(1..3,7..8,11..16,19..23)
\&  mRNA    XXX\-\-\-\-\-\-\-XXXXXX\-\-XXXX         join(1..3,11..16,19..23)
\&  CDS                 XXXX\-\-XX           join(13..16,19..20)
\&  CDS                 XXXX\-\-XX           join(13..16,19..20)
.Ve
.PP
[obviously the positions have been scaled down]
.PP
We cannot unambiguously match mRNA with \s-1CDS\s0 based on splice sites,
since both \s-1CDS\s0 share the splice site locations 16^17 and
18^19. However, the consequences of making a wrong match are probably
not very severe. Any annotation data attached to the first \s-1CDS\s0 is
probably identical to the seconds \s-1CDS\s0, other than identifiers.
.PP
The default behaviour of this module is to make an arbitrary call
where it is ambiguous (the mapping will always be bijective; i.e. one
mRNA \-> one \s-1CDS\s0).
.PP
[\s-1TODO:\s0 \s-1NOTE:\s0 not tested on \s-1EMBL\s0 data, which may not be bijective; ie two
mRNAs can share the same \s-1CDS\s0??]
.PP
This completes the building of the containment hierarchy; other
optional step follow
.SH "POST-GROUPING STEPS"
.IX Header "POST-GROUPING STEPS"
.SS "Inferring exons from mRNAs"
.IX Subsection "Inferring exons from mRNAs"
This step always occurs if \fB\-use_magic\fR is invoked.
.PP
In a typical GenBank entry, the exons are \fBimplicit\fR. That is they
can be inferred from the mRNA location.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     mRNA            join(20111..20584,20887..23268)
.Ve
.PP
This tells us that this particular transcript has two exons. In
bioperl, the mRNA feature will have a 'split location'.
.PP
If we call
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $unflattener\->feature_from_splitloc(\-seq=>$seq);
.Ve
.PP
This will generate the necessary exon features, and nest them under
the appropriate mRNAs. Note that the mRNAs will no longer have split
locations \- they will have simple locations spanning the extent of the
exons. This is intentional, to avoid redundancy.
.PP
Occasionally a GenBank entry will have both implicit exons (from the
mRNA location) \fBand\fR explicit exon features.
.PP
In this case, exons will still be transferred. Tag-value data from the
explicit exon will be transfered to the implicit exon. If exons are
shared between mRNAs these will be represented by different
objects. Any inconsistencies between implicit and explicit will be
reported.
.PP
\fItRNAs and other noncoding RNAs\fR
.IX Subsection "tRNAs and other noncoding RNAs"
.PP
exons will also be generated from these features
.SS "Inferring mRNAs from \s-1CDS\s0"
.IX Subsection "Inferring mRNAs from CDS"
Some GenBank entries represent gene models using features of type
gene, mRNA and \s-1CDS\s0; some entries just use gene and \s-1CDS\s0.
.PP
If we only have gene and \s-1CDS\s0, then the containment hierarchies will
look like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  gene
\&    CDS
.Ve
.PP
If we want the containment hierarchies to be uniform, like this
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  gene
\&    mRNA
\&      CDS
.Ve
.PP
Then we must create an mRNA feature. This will have identical
coordinates to the \s-1CDS\s0. The assumption is that there is either no
untranslated region, or it is unknown.
.PP
To do this, we can call
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $unflattener\->infer_mRNA_from_CDS(\-seq=>$seq);
.Ve
.PP
This is taken care of automatically, if \fB\-use_magic\fR is invoked.
.SH "ADVANCED"
.IX Header "ADVANCED"
.SS "Customising the grouping of features"
.IX Subsection "Customising the grouping of features"
The default behaviour is suited mostly to building models of protein
coding genes and noncoding genes from genbank genomic \s-1DNA\s0 submissions.
.PP
You can change the tag used to partition the feature by passing in a
different group_tag argument \- see the \fIunflatten_seq()\fR method
.PP
Other behaviour may be desirable. For example, even though SNPs
(features of type 'variation' in GenBank) are not actually part of the
gene model, it may be desirable to group SNPs that overlap or are
nearby gene models.
.PP
It should certainly be possible to extend this module to do
this. However, I have yet to code this part!!! If anyone would find
this useful let me know.
.PP
In the meantime, you could write your own grouping subroutine, and
feed the results into \fIunflatten_groups()\fR [see the method documentation
below]
.SS "Customising the resolution of the containment hierarchy"
.IX Subsection "Customising the resolution of the containment hierarchy"
Once the flat list of features has been partitioned into groups, the
method \fIunflatten_group()\fR is called on each group to build a tree.
.PP
The algorithm for doing this is described above; ambiguities are
resolved by using splice coordinates. As discussed, this can be
ambiguous.
.PP
Some submissions may contain information in tags/attributes that hint

For example, with the Drosophila Melanogaster release 3 submission, we
see that \s-1CDS\s0 features in alternately spliced mRNAs have a form like
this:

We can customise the behaviour of \fIunflatten_group()\fR by providing our
own resolver method. This obviously requires a bit of extra
programming, but there is no way to get around this.
.PP
Here is an example of how to pass in your own resolver; this example
basically checks the parent (container) /product tag to see if it
matches the required string in the child (contained) /note tag.

Ideally we would like a way of combining a mRNA record with the
corresponding SeFeature entry from the appropriate genomic \s-1DNA\s0

mRNA sequences may not match 100% (due to differences in strain,
assembly problems, sequencing problems, etc). What then...?

Unflattener is very particular about problems it finds along the
way. If you have set the error_threshold such that less severe
problems do not cause exceptions, Unflattener still expects you to
\&\fIreport_problems()\fR at the end, so that the user of the module is aware
of any inconsistencies or problems with the data. In fact, a warning
will be produced if there are unreported problems. To silence, this
warning, call the \fIignore_problems()\fR method before the Unflattener
object is destroyed.
