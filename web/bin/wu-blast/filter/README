This directory is often installed in the location /usr/ncbi/blast/filter.
If a different location is desired, use the WUBLASTFILTER (or BLASTFILTER)
environment variable to direct the BLAST programs where to look.  See the
README.html for more details about the use of environment variables and the
WUBLASTFILTER variable in particular.

The "filter" directory can contain executables for masking query sequences of
low-complexity regions (or potentially any other regions of one's own design).
These executables are invoked indirectly using the "filter=" option or
"wordfilter=" option of the BLAST programs.  Filter programs must be capable of
reading FASTA format sequences from standard input and writing their results in
FASTA format to standard output.  Filter programs are maintained separately
from the BLAST search programs, so they may be updated independently and
extended if desired.  Pipelines of filter programs can be established in
scripts placed in this directory or in commands fully specified in a filter=
or wordfilter= command line option.

Typical filters that the BLAST programs know about are "seg" (Wootton and
Federhen), "xnu" (Claverie and States), and "dust" (Tatusov and Lipman).

While individual filter and wordfilter specifications can themselves be
comprised of command pipelines, as in "filter=seg - -x | xnu -", the BLAST
programs permit multiple filter= and wordfilter= options to be specified.
Each filter (or wordfilter) specified will be executed in succession and the
individual results are then OR-ed with one another.


Source code for seg is available at URL ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/seg

The seg distribution includes code for "pmerge" and "nmerge", two programs
that logically OR masked regions from multiple protein/nucleotide sequences
into a single FASTA-format output data stream.  These programs can be used
to combine the results of applying multiple filter programs (or the same
filter program with multiple sets of parameters).  pmerge expects masked
residues will be represented by Xs, whereas nmerge expects masked residues
will be represented by Ns.

The script "seg+xnu" and "xnu+seg" executes seg and xnu, then runs pmerge
to OR the results to stdout.

Source code for xnu is available at URL ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/jmc/xnu
